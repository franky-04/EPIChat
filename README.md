# EPIChat
This is the capstone project for the **EPICODE Web Development course 2023**

**EPIChat** is a full stack web application that allows registered users to have a text chat, send images and store all the conversations, this app is developed with the **MERN** stack (React, Express, MongoDB, NodeJS) wich are the technologies studied during the EPICODE course. 

This app is composed by a React Front-End Client that allows the user to register/login and start a new conversation with another user, a NodeJS + ExpressJS Back-end API that implements the business logic and a MongoDB database to store all the conversations so that the user can retrive them anytime.

This web app is developed by applyng all the concepts and best practices studied throughout the course. 

**Websocket** thecnology is one of the crucial point of this app, infact, the only way to develop a chat app is by using this kind of interactive and two-way communication beetween user's browser and server. To manage websocketS in an easier and quicker manner, i decided to use the library **Socket.io**.
